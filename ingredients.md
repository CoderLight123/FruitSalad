Ingredients for this Easy Fruit Salad


Strawberries – to select good strawberries it’s kind of a no brainer. They should have a nice red color, no dark spots, no mold, and check out the leaves – those green tops should look vibrant and fresh.

Pineapple – to pick a good pineapple smell the bottom, it should have that sweet pineapple scent. To know when it’s ripe the skin should be turning yellow and it should have some give when pressed.

Blueberries – I like those plump juicy blueberries here. They tend to be sweeter.

Red grapes – to choose good grapes squeeze a couple of them, they should be firm and plump, they should also look tight and intact to the stems (not loose) and they should have a nice color.

Kiwi – to select kiwi look for some that are fairly soft when pressed. Those that are firm are sour and unripe. Small or large size won’t matter.

Mandarin oranges – I used to use canned mandarins here but I prefer fresh now. Either will work great. Mangoes work well as a substitute for the oranges.

Bananas – these are optional. If you do add them just use yellow bananas. No green peel (not sweet enough) and no brown (too mushy).

Honey – I don’t recommend substitutions for this unless there’s an allergy (if so I’d maybe try maple syrup or brown rice syrup).

Limes – in a pinch lemons would work too.
